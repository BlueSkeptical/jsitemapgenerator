# Contributing to jsitemapgenerator
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

I'd appreciate contribution of any kind: issue, pull request, beer :-D

Originally I built this project for myself and I thought that it could be useful for others, so I made it public (in 2013). 
Over time with help of others I enhanced it so that now it does everything regarding sitemap generation (and more) 
with a nice functional API.

I know that sitemap generation isn't hot topic, but if this project helps somebody, 
it's making (at least his/hers) world a better place :-D
